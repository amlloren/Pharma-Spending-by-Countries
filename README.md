## Business Case

Our team has selected the Pharmaceutical Drug Spending by Countries dataset and will be investigating "Cost Optimization." By identifying high and low spenders, countries can adopt best practices to optimize their pharmaceutical spending.

## Team Work Agreement

* We all agreed that we will independently work on all parts of the project and then during the 2nd team project week, we will compare, contrast and compile our findings into our Main branch.
* We will meet up on at 1pm during our next few Friday work periods and allocate 30 mins to an hour discussing our team project.
* In the meantime, we will each create our own branches to the dsi_team_22 repo where we will commit and push the research, code and analysis we independently work on.
* The focus for the upcoming weeks will be on data cleaning (How to decide what to do with missing data) as well as categorizing the dataset by the Top, Bottom, and mid level spenders. Explore the three categories and document your findings and analysis.
* As we progress with the next few modules, we will revisit our tasks and deliverables for our team project
